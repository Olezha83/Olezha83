## 👋 Hi, I'm Oleg!

I'm passionate about front-end web development 💙💚🧡

### 📚 What I've Learned
I’ve studied **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **React** during courses, which helped me build a solid foundation in front-end development.

### 🛠️ What I Practice
In addition to that, I’ve gained hands-on experience with:
- Gulp
- SASS
- BEM methodology
- Swiper.js
- Bootstrap
- Pixel Perfect layout

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
I'm currently working on a **pet project** — an online tableware store (repository: [brilliance](https://github.com/Olezha83/brilliance)) — to strengthen my skills and explore new technologies and tools.

And I'm really excited about it!
